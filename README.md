# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Resources
- Software: Mapbox API, d3.js, JSON data (GeoJSON), Leaflet.js, Javascript, HTML, CSS

## Project Overview
In this project, I was tasked to create a map of earthquake activity using GeoJSON data. The size and color of the Circle markers correspond to the magnitude and location of the recorded earthquake activity. As you can see on the map below, I added the filters for Earthquakes, Tectonic Plates, and Major Earthquakes for easy filtering of results. Additionally, I added Dark, Streets, and Satellite modes for further visualization.
